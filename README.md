# Play it here!

## Running it locally
1. `npm install`
2. `gulp`
3. `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` (was too lazy to set up anything fancier)
3. Go to http://localhost:8000


Note: This was thrown together for Nordic.js, and is a bit of a shitshow codewise. I may clean it up eventually because there are some parts that I really like.

### Yo how does this work?

All JavaScript and WebGL (using THREE.js). Isn't that crazy? And it runs on desktop/mobile, and with all VR headsets thanks to the WebVR boilerplate (http://borismus.github.io/webvr-boilerplate/)
